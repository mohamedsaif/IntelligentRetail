* **Contoso Market** has a huge distribution network of supermarket chains across over fourteen countries. Each of these distributors is required to arrange drinks on their stands according to standardized policies. Each policy describes what shelf a given drink should be on and in what order it should be stocked.​

* There are huge costs associated with "routine" audit activities to enforce these policies. **Contoso Market** wanted to develop a system in which an auditor or store manager could take a picture and be told immediately whether the shelf was stocked correctly, like in the image below.​
